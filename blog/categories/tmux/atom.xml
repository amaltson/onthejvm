    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a> for a while and love it.
I had heard of tmux on various podcasts and through Twitter, but I was finally
convinced to try it in early 2012 after listening to the <a href="http://thechangelog.com/73/">tmux episode on the Changelog</a>
(excellent podcast by-the-way). I went out and got the book that was the topic
of the podcast, <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux/tmux">tmux: Productive Mouse-Free Development</a>.</p>

<p>After some experimentation, I got into a good workflow with tmux. I particularly
like using tmux with <a href="https://github.com/aziz/tmuxinator">tmuxinator</a> to set up
projects and easily launch a full tmux environment with all my panes and windows
running the applications I configured in the tmuxinator YAML file.</p>

<p>As much as I loved tmux, one thing really bugged me. If I had several tmux
sessions open, which I was prone to do as I&rsquo;d move from project to project, the
bell kept going off. When I say bell, I mean the terminal bell. It&rsquo;d go off
regardless of whether something was happening in that tmux session. I use iTerm
and Growl, so bell events end up popping up through Growl. This is actually
super useful. When you have a long running task in a tab you&rsquo;re not looking at,
when the tab completes and becomes idle, I get a nice Growl alert. It&rsquo;s not so
useful when it happens all the time and nothing actually happens in the tab.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tmux-bell.png" alt="tmux-bell" /></p>

<p>I did a bunch of Googling trying to figure out why it was happening, thinking it
might be a tmux bug, or an iTerm bug. I came up with nothing, so I forgot about
it and just ignored the Growl notifications. Then, all the sudden, on day it
dawned on me. I looked at the corner of my tmux window and there was the answer.</p>

<p>The corner of the tmux window holds the tmux status bar. As it turns out,
the default tmux configuration holds the date and <strong>time</strong>, in <strong>minutes</strong>.
Every minute, each tab that&rsquo;s running tmux updates to display the current time.
Time keeps going forward and every minute I got an alert.</p>

<p>The solution was easy, change the default status bar to only show the day and
month.</p>

<p><code>
set -g status-right "#T %d %b"
</code></p>

<p>Voila! Now my bells and Growl notifications are useful again.</p>
