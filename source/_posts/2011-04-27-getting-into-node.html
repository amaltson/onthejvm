<p>Most of the net is <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/03/10/node-js/">abuzz</a> about <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node</a>,
so it&rsquo;s hard to miss it. I&rsquo;ve been sitting on the sidelines for several months now, but after
attending a <a href="http://techtalksto.com/post/4087265108/the-video-from-techtalksto-episode-3-with-james">TechTalksTO talk on Node</a>
given by James Duncan of Joyent, I&rsquo;m convinced I should dive in.</p>

<h2>tl;dr version</h2>

<ul>
<li>Like C, Javascript is here to stay.</li>
<li>Asynchronous (everywhere) is the future.</li>
<li>Node is an exciting platform you have to check out.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What is Node?</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/joyent/node">Node</a> is a server side Javascript
implementation. As James put it, Node is the Google Chrome V8 Javascript
engine and libev glued together. V8 provides the super fast Javascript
virtual machine while libev contributes the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop">event loop</a>. Of course, it&rsquo;s
more complicated than that, but those are the basics.</p>

<p>To make full use of this fast underpinning, Node follows a non-blocking,
fully asynchronous programming mode, and encourages libraries to follow
its example.</p>

<h2>Why Node and Not Another Server Side Javascript?</h2>

<p>The best known server side Javascript implementation is Rhino. However,
as Dhanji Prasanna asked <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dhanji/status/45307909709627393">on Twitter</a>,</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>Are there any fast alternatives to Rhino on JVM?</p></blockquote>

<p>Most of the server side Javascript implementations didn&rsquo;t
grasp the importance of non-blocking, asynchronous I/O.</p>

<h2>Why Asynchronous?</h2>

<p>Asynchronous programming is usually associated with GUI development
where everything is event driven and asynchronous. Why would you bring this to
the server? Well, for one, blocking sucks. James made this point very potent
by showing the amount of CPU cycles spent accessing each layer in a computer.
Starting from L1 cache, L2 cache, RAM, disk and finally the network, each
layer adds many orders of magnitude to the amount of time the CPU sits
blocked, waiting for the call to return.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why you want non-blocking I/O. As the Mashable
article (above) said about the history of Node, Ryan Dhal tried the
Node approach on a number of languages, in all cases failing, because of the
culture of synchronous, blocking programming. But Javascript, being a
front end language, has always been event driven and asynchronous.</p>

<h2>How Much Does This Buy You? (Easy C10K)</h2>

<p>What does this approach really buy you? As James pointed out, it buys
you easy <em>C10K</em>. What&rsquo;s that you ask? 10 thousand concurrent
connections. In fact, Node seems to be able to handle <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1088699">100K concurrent
connections</a> on a single,
mildly beefy server. In benchmarks, Node competes at the level of Nginx,
a C based web framework built around the same principles. This is a
testament to the power of V8.</p>

<p>Asynchronous programming has been around for a long time, but has started
to gain popularity recently. The benefits are evident, take the recent
<a href="http://engineering.twitter.com/2011/04/twitter-search-is-now-3x-faster_1656.html">search speed increase at Twitter</a>
after they adopted Netty and an asynchronous model.</p>

<h2>Alright, I&rsquo;m sold. Now what?</h2>

<p>Getting started with Node is easy, if you&rsquo;re on a Mac, I highly
recommend installing it through <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>brew install node</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Now try out Node&rsquo;s obligatory &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo;. Create <em>server.js</em>,</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(8080, &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;);

console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8080/');</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Then run</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>node server.js</pre></div>
</div>


<p>And voilà! Your first node app.</p>

<h2>Great&hellip; Anything Else?</h2>

<p>Tons. One of Node&rsquo;s biggest strengths is the huge community that&rsquo;s
sprouted around it. As RedMonk discussed in their recent <a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2011/03/17/framework-traction-on-hacker-news/">Programming
Language Framework Traction on Hacker News</a>,
&ldquo;What’s interesting is that the much younger Node.js is beginning to approach Django both in growth rate and visibility.&rdquo;
This is evident by the number of new libraries and the speed at which
they are being developed.</p>

<p>The best way to install plugins is to use <a href="http://npmjs.org/">npm</a>. Some
of the more popular plugins are,</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/express">express</a> &ndash; a Sinatra inspired
framework.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/learnboost/Socket.IO-node">socket.io</a> &ndash; server
push support.</li>
<li><a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">backbone.js</a> &ndash; a popular
MVC framework for Javascript, works with Node as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom">jsdom</a> &ndash; web scraping 2.0, powered
by Node.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/chriso/node.io">node.io</a> &ndash; another scraping
library, this looks even better then jsdom.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/raycmorgan/Mu">Mustache</a> &ndash; template engine, used
by Twitter (the JS version).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/jade">Jade</a> &ndash; another template engine,
inspired by HAML.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus">stylus</a> &ndash; a SCSS or LESS
inspired CSS engine.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose">mongoose</a> &ndash; MongoDB ORM
layer.</li>
</ul>


<h2>A Look at Express</h2>

<p>The Node ecosystem is growing by leaps and bounds, but I wanted to
highlight one of the more popular libraries. Making web application
development in Node easier, Express has become a trademark in most Node web apps.
Let&rsquo;s see how easy it is to use.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>var app = express.createServer();

app.get('/', function(req, res){
    res.send('Hello World');
});

app.listen(8080);</pre></div>
</div>


<h2>Hosting</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;re all excited to get started on Node, but you&rsquo;re wondering where to host
your new Node application. There is a great
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3648993/where-can-i-host-a-node-js-app">stackoverflow question</a>
that has a lot of options. Another recent contender in hosting Node applications is VMware with
<a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.com/">Cloud Foundry</a>. I&rsquo;ve tried both Joyent&rsquo;s <a href="http://no.de">http://no.de</a>
and Cloud Foundry.</p>

<p>Node is an exciting platform that&rsquo;s experiencing explosive growth. If
you&rsquo;ve been sitting on the fence, now is a great time to jump in.</p>
